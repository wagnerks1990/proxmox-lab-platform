# LabGoblin brand and naming

## Canonical identity

| --- | --- |
| Product | **LabGoblin** |
| Category | Virtual Lab Provisioning & Management |
| Primary tagline | **Real Skills. Virtual Machines.** |
| Campaign line | **Build. Deploy. Learn. Repeat.** |
| Alternate campaign line | Virtual Labs. Real Opportunities. |
| Technical identifier | `labgoblin` |
| Service prefix | `labgoblin-` |
| Install root | `/opt/labgoblin` |
| State root | `/var/lib/labgoblin` |
| Session cookie | `labgoblin_session` |
| Repository | `https://github.com/wagnerks1990/labgoblin.git` |

LabGoblin is the product. Proxmox VE is currently the primary hypervisor integration and should be named only where the underlying platform matters technically.

## Positioning

LabGoblin gives instructors and students a controlled layer over virtual lab infrastructure. It covers templates, assignments, lab runs, provisioning, lifecycle operations, access policy, reconciliation, and auditing without exposing broad hypervisor access to students.

In the broader Goblin product family:

- **RoomGoblin** manages classrooms and physical labs.
- **LabGoblin** manages virtual labs and student virtual environments.
- **PatchGoblin** is reserved for patch/update management.
- **ScreenGoblin** is reserved for digital signage.

Avoid copy that makes these products sound interchangeable.

## Voice

LabGoblin should sound technical, capable, approachable, education-first, and slightly playful. Use direct language. The goblin identity adds personality; it must not reduce clarity around security, destructive actions, permissions, or operational status.

## Color system

| Token | Hex | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goblin Green | `#22C55E` | Primary brand/action |
| Deep Space | `#0B1220` | Main dark background |
| Slate Surface | `#1F2937` | Cards/panels |
| Steel Secondary | `#3B4754` | Secondary UI |
| Cloud Light | `#E5E7EB` | Light neutral/text |
| Mint Accent | `#A7F3D0` | Success/highlight |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | High-contrast text |

Green should identify primary actions, active state, success, and brand emphasis. Do not flood large UI surfaces with saturated green. Never rely on green alone to communicate state; use text and/or an icon as well.

## Typography

- Preferred UI/body: **Inter**.
- Optional display/marketing: **Poppins**.
- Fallback: `system-ui, "Segoe UI", Arial, sans-serif`.

Font binaries are not stored in the repository. Use properly licensed sources if web fonts are added later.

## Logo and icon

The canonical application icon is `frontend/public/brand/labgoblin-icon.svg`.

Rules:

- Do not stretch, skew, or rotate the logo.
- Keep adequate clear space around the mark.
- Do not recolor the green mark arbitrarily.
- Do not use decorative glow/shadow effects where they reduce legibility.
- Use accessible `alt` text when the mark communicates identity; use empty `alt` text when adjacent text already says LabGoblin.

## Clean-install naming policy

This repository is development software intended for fresh installations. LabGoblin-owned runtime and developer identifiers use LabGoblin naming directly; predecessor compatibility aliases are not required.

Canonical examples:

- repository: `wagnerks1990/labgoblin`
- Compose project: `labgoblin`
- PostgreSQL default database/user: `labgoblin`
- updater group and unit: `labgoblin-updater` / `labgoblin-updater.service`
- updater executable: `/usr/local/lib/labgoblin-updater.py`
- host runner: `labgoblin-runner`
- host helper: `/usr/local/sbin/labgoblin-asset-server`
- asset units: `labgoblin-iso-server.service` and `labgoblin-ct-template-server.service`
- logger namespace: `labgoblin`
- frontend package: `labgoblin-frontend`

Do not introduce LabGoblin-owned identifiers using predecessor forms such as `proxmox-lab-platform`, `proxmox_lab`, `plp_`, or `proxmox-lab-*`.

## Legitimate Proxmox terminology

Do not mechanically remove the word Proxmox. These names describe the supported hypervisor integration and should remain when technically accurate:

- `PROXMOX_*` configuration variables;
- `ProxmoxCluster`, `ProxmoxNode`, and other integration models;
- Proxmox API clients, URLs, token concepts, VMIDs and UPIDs;
- Proxmox Setup, Inventory, Assets, and integration documentation;
- database tables whose domain object is specifically a Proxmox resource.

The distinction is ownership: LabGoblin-owned runtime names use LabGoblin; integration-domain names use Proxmox where appropriate.

## Repository naming

The canonical GitHub repository is `wagnerks1990/labgoblin`. Active installer, updater, MkDocs, documentation, automation, test, and AI-agent references must point to the canonical repository and must not rely on GitHub redirects from the retired repository path.

## AI/coding-agent contract

Agents must read `AI_CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and this file before branding or infrastructure changes. Agents must keep documentation synchronized and must not weaken authorization, tenant isolation, secret handling, auditability, durable operations, update safety, or rollback behavior for the sake of rebranding.
