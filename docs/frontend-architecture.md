# Frontend architecture

LabGoblin's frontend is a React and Vite single-page application. It presents
the same control-plane API through role-appropriate workflows; it is not an
authorization boundary. Every operation remains authorized by the backend.
Student, instructor, tenant-administrator, and platform-administrator views use
the same shell with different capability-filtered destinations.

## Information architecture

The application shell separates routine lab work from administration:

- **Workspace** provides the overview, assigned VMs, student provisioning, and
  durable-operation activity.
- **Teaching** contains classes, sessions, pools, and classroom events for
  instructors and tenant administrators.
- **People & access** contains organization, user, and group administration for
  the applicable tenant or platform role.
- **Platform administration** contains infrastructure, templates, users,
  organizations, telemetry, troubleshooting, and updates for platform admins.

Navigation visibility is derived from the authenticated platform role and the
selected organization's tenant role. Hiding a link never replaces a backend
authorization check. Direct navigation to a disallowed route must render the
access-denied state.

## Structure

- `pages/` contains route-level workflow containers.
- `layouts/` contains the application shell and navigation.
- `components/` contains reusable presentation and interaction primitives.
- `components/operational/` contains shared status and activity views.
- `services/` contains API adapters.
- `hooks/` contains stateful browser and streaming logic.
- `auth/` contains capability derivation and authentication-state helpers.
- `state/` contains external stores used by live operational views.
- `styles.css` contains tokens and shared responsive primitives.
- `generated/` contains generated OpenAPI types and is never edited manually.

Page containers own data loading and workflow orchestration. Repeated form,
status, table, toolbar, dialog, and empty/error/loading patterns belong in
shared components. API access must continue through the `/api` client.

## Responsive contract

The interface must work without page-level horizontal scrolling at a 320 CSS
pixel viewport. The supported validation widths are:

| Mode | Validation viewport | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compact phone | 320 to 479 px | Off-canvas navigation, one-column content, full-width primary controls |
| Phone | 390 x 844 | Touch-friendly actions and stacked detail views |
| Tablet | 768 x 1024 | Compact navigation and adaptive grids |
| Small desktop | 1024 x 768 | Persistent shell where space permits |
| Desktop | 1440 x 900 | Persistent grouped navigation and bounded readable content |

Dense tables must be placed in a labeled scroll container or transformed into
readable cards. Controls may wrap, but primary and destructive actions must not
become ambiguous. Console canvases and terminals resize to their container.

## Accessibility contract

- Use one page-level `h1` and preserve heading order.
- Provide a keyboard-visible skip link to the main content.
- Identify the current navigation destination with `aria-current="page"`.
- Give every input a persistent accessible name; placeholders are examples,
  not labels.
- Mobile navigation exposes its expanded state and closes with Escape, after
  route selection, and when the viewport leaves compact mode.
- Modal dialogs have a name, deliberately manage focus, close with Escape when
  safe, and return focus to their trigger.
- Status changes use `role="status"`; failures requiring attention use
  `role="alert"`.
- Focus indicators, disabled state, and status meaning never depend on color
  alone.
- Pointer targets are at least 44 CSS pixels in compact layouts.
- Motion honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## View state contract

Every data-backed view distinguishes loading, empty, error, and populated
states. An unavailable API must never silently appear as an empty successful
list. Mutations expose a busy state, prevent duplicate submission, preserve the
server's error detail when safe, and announce the result.

Durable VM operations remain visibly queued or running until the backend
reports a terminal result. The frontend must not invent successful Proxmox
state. Destructive operations retain their server-provided preview and exact
confirmation contract.

## Security boundaries

- Session JWTs remain in HttpOnly cookies.
- Organization selection may be stored locally; credentials, tickets, secrets,
  and reusable grants may not.
- Proxmox and console tickets never appear in browser URLs or frontend state.
- Cookie-authenticated mutations and WebSockets remain same-origin.
- The SSH terminal control remains absent unless the server explicitly enables
  the hardened feature.

## Testing layers

Dependency-free source-contract tests protect security and structural
invariants. Rendered component and browser tests should cover behavior that
source inspection cannot prove. See [Frontend testing](development/frontend-testing.md)
and [GUI validation](gui-section-validation.md).
